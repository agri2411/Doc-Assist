# Doc-Assist
BI teams often spend hours manually documenting dashboards, KPIs, SQL queries, and filter logic for knowledge sharing and compliance. 
Our project, Doc Assist, automates this documentation process by leveraging OpenAI's GPT models to parse Pentaho CDE .cdfde files and generate human-readable documentation in Markdown.

It extracts datasources, parameters, components, and embedded SQL logic, then produces clear documentation for Confluence or Git integration.
This tool saves hours of manual effort, improves cross-team understanding of complex dashboards, and brings AI-driven automation to legacy BI systems.
